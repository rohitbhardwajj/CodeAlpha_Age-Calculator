# CodeAlpha_Age-Calculator
"During my internship at Code Alpha, I successfully developed an age calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project honed my skills in web development, allowing me to create a dynamic and user-friendly tool that accurately calculates age from a given date of birth. The experience not only improved my coding proficiency."
